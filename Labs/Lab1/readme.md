## IT1150 Lab 1

There are two parts of this lab, one is written (edit this readme.md file) and the other is hands-on (edit .html and .css files.) 

### Executive Summary
In summary I have learned a great bit through this Lab. The terms I will be using and getting to know more and the hands on experience in VS Code will go a long way, especially with more time and learning.

### Part 1 Written:

#### The W3C
The W3C is the World Wide Web Consortium. W3C is a international community where really everyone can work together to develop Web standards. "W3C's mission is to lead the web to its full potential."

#### Usability, Cross-Browser Compatibility, Accessibility, Search Engine Optimization and Responsive Web Design
Usability can be part of another term, "user experience." This word means the ease of use in a device or a website and how easy the experience is. Cross-Browser Compatibility is simply the function of a website or application when used on different browsers such as, degrading or changing based on feature difference or loss. Accessibility is a very key part of designing that deals with making sure your product is as accessible to as many people as possible. This can be done by making products compatible with many different platforms, systems and having easy to use features in for all users. Search Engine Optimization is things that can effect the visibility of a site. Sites that are higher ranked in search results and more sought out will appear more in searches, thus resulting in more traffic to the website that could be turned into revunue and customers. Responsive Web Design, also known as RWD is web designing that makes sites render and fit correctly on multiple different platforms and devices. Having a good functional site for users use is needed and in the very competitive online market, sites need to work very well and perfect acceptional to satify users.

### Part 2 Hands-On:
1. Open your cloned repository in Visual Studio Code and traverse to the "Lab1" Files.  Take a screen shot of your success and name the file "Lab1Part2No1" Upload your screen shot to the Lab1 directory

2. Pick a theme for your site. Find at least one image and one external site that you would like to include. Upload the image to your repository (locally and then "push" it to GitHub / conversly "pull" changes on GitHub to your local repo)

3. Using the semantic elements: header, main and footer edit the included .html file to create your web page. Be sure to include the folowing tags in your page:
   1. h1/6, p, line break
   2. Anchor
   3. Image
   4. CSS Link
   5. List - ordered or unordered
   
4. Take a screen shot of your web page in the browser and name the file "Lab1Part2No3" Upload your image to the Lab1 directory
  
### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I feel this lab greatly helped me grasp and understanding and get a starting point for web designing and I will use the things I have learned in this lab to further myself through this class and after.
